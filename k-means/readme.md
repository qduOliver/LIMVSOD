In k-means, run .py sequentially in numerical order.

Through the OB section, we get all the object boxesã€‚
first,1proportion.py changing the value of the motion value according to the significance proportion of the optical flow frame occupied by each object boxes.
Second, 2k_means.py cluster all the object boxes into 8 classes. 
Third,3julei_MV ,evaluate a motion value value for each class. 
Then,4, 5 and 6 are to divide the 8 clusters into positive and negative samples according to the motionvalue value.
Then,7motionValue_choose.py and 8second_julei.py filter positive and negative samples by motion value and distance to the center of the class, respectively. 
Finally 9 got the data used to train the classifier for the first time.
